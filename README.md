# webhead
a web-based comic viewer (cbr/cbz/zip/rar). originally forked from kthoom.


broad goal is to modernize the originally implemented technology (integrate LESS and bootstrap, update js) while also updating the UX. The original UX was functional but lacking, and I would like to fix that.


As much as possible, I would like to bring most common features from desktop comic readers into this (two-page view, page previews from a gutter, etc).
